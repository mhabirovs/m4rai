The main part of the project is contained in the 'M4RAI_Group5.ipynb' notebook. There is a model training part, results, calibration, as well as an uncertainty analysis.

The 'EDA.ipynb' notebook features the Exploratory Data Analysis of a Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.
The 'Explainability.ipynb' notebook features the model's explainability analysis.

There are no strict run instructions, it is sufficient to run the whole notebook cell by cell, making sure that all packages are pre-installed, and path to the data is changed accordingly to user's system.
The dataset.rar archive has to be unzipped.
