The main part of the project is contained in the 'M4RAI_Group5.ipynb' notebook. There is a model training part and results.

The 'EDA.ipynb' notebook features the Exploratory Data Analysis of a Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.
The 'Initial Performance.ipynb' notebook features the initial baseline models setup and evaluation for a future comparison.
The 'Post-Processing.ipynb' notebook features a post-processing uncertainty analysis.

There are no strict run instructions, it is sufficient to run the whole notebook cell by cell, making sure that all packages are pre-installed.
